# Parts list

* Just Add Board - https://shop.justaddsharks.co.uk/collections/featured/products/open-source-break-in-board
* Leetro PAD003 & Cable - 

* Raspberry Pi 3
* RS232 header for Raspberry Pi - https://www.tindie.com/products/DTronixs/raspberry-piio-minipiio-rs232-add-on-board/

N.B. you'll need to substitute a different DB9 connector to the one that comes
with the RS232 header board. This is supplied with a DB9 male which is a
standard serial port, however the Leetro control panel is also DB9 male. I'd
suggest the following part from Farnell:

  

I didn't know this in advance so ended up making a gender changer up using
parts from the junk box. That was annoying but also kinda useful as it let me
build a DB9 to DB9 adapter that I could insert power into for developing on a
standard serial port rather than just on the Pi RS232 board with the power
hack.

* Arduino Uno
* GRBL v3 CNC shield
