I didn't know this in advance so ended up making a gender changer up using
parts from the junk box. That was annoying but also kinda useful as it let me
build a DB9 to DB9 adapter that I could insert power into for developing on a
standard serial port rather than just on the Pi RS232 board with the power
hack.

* Arduino Uno
* GRBL v3 CNC shield

* Self adhesive PCB mounts - http://cpc.farnell.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?partNumber=PC01959
